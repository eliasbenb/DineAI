# Croud Rating and Commenting for One: a Web Development Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a dedicated web platform for a single restaurant, inspired by the concept of Yelp, but with a unique focus on fostering customer interaction and engagement around the restaurant's menu. The platform will allow customers to rate, comment, and share their experiences with individual dishes, rather than focusing on taking orders or reservations. This system will enhance the dining experience by providing valuable feedback for both the restaurant and its patrons.

The website will be built using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, offering a user-friendly interface for diners to easily navigate and contribute their thoughts on the menu items. By focusing on community-driven feedback, this platform will give the restaurant insights into popular dishes, customer preferences, and areas for improvement.

## Key Features

1. **Dish Rating System**: Customers can rate each dish on a scale (e.g., 1 to 5 stars) based on their experience.
2. **Dish Comments**: Users can leave detailed comments about the dishes they've tried, offering constructive feedback or sharing recommendations.
3. **User Profiles**: Customers will have the option to create profiles to keep track of their ratings and reviews.
4. **Dish Details Page**: Each dish will have a dedicated page showcasing its description, ingredients, and reviews from other customers.
5. **Responsive Design**: The platform will be fully responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktops.
6. **Search Functionality**: Users can search for dishes or browse by category, making it easier to explore the restaurant’s offerings.

## Technologies

- **JavaScript**: To implement interactivity, including the rating system, comment functionality, and user profiles.
- **HTML5**: For structuring the website’s content.
- **CSS3**: For styling and ensuring a modern, clean, and user-friendly design.
- **Local Storage (optional)**: For saving user data (like ratings and comments) locally, allowing users to access their profiles across sessions without requiring a backend database.

## Target Audience

- **Restaurant Diners**: The primary users of the platform will be customers of the restaurant who wish to share their opinions and feedback.
- **Restaurant Management**: The platform will provide insights into the most popular dishes, customer preferences, and suggestions for improvement.
  
## Project Goals

- Create an engaging platform that encourages diners to share their thoughts on the restaurant’s menu.
- Enable the restaurant to gather valuable customer feedback for improving their offerings and customer experience.
- Build a visually appealing and responsive website that works seamlessly on different devices.
